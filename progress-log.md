## 2025-05-17

- Learned the conceptual difference between Docker Image (like a class) and Container (like an instance).
- Understood why devcontainers in VS Code trigger `docker build` automatically.
- Learned that Docker containers and images accumulate and consume disk space if not cleaned.

- Solved LeetCode #1 Two Sum and fully understood hash map approach.
- Felt very sleepy, so postponed the second problem to tomorrow. (#20 Valid Parentheses)

- ✅ Solved LeetCode #20: Valid Parentheses  
  - Used a stack to match open and close brackets.  
  - Realized it's very similar to MTG’s stack resolution—LIFO behavior.  
  - Code became elegant (possibly AI-influenced), but I fully understood the logic.  
  - `return not stack` means all open brackets have been matched and removed. 
  - I learned LIFO behavior by coding and could image clearly than before.
